# AdditionandReplacement
Code for the model on addition and replacement of E. coli infections

This is the code for the 10 year calculations.

It does not matter which file you run first, each file can be run independently.
The file can be split in sections, run the section in chronological order, otherwise errors will be produced. 
For each mechanism, run the entire file, otherwise incorrect results will be produced. 

Each mechanisms code contains the neutral code and is then expended with the mechanism.

At the end of the code a table is printed containing the results. 

Enjoy!
