# AdditionandReplacement
Code for the model on addition and replacement of E. coli infections

You need to install Wolfram Mathematica (We used version 12.1) to run the code. 

Three branches yield the codes for prections in 10 years, 50 years and when time is set to infinity. 

Each branch contains a read me file.

Each mechanism has a seperate code file, which you can run to get the results for that mechanism.

Good luck!
